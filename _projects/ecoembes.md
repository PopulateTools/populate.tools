description: "Ecoembes had the challenge of making great amounts of data accessible and usable by both employees and external collaborators. Current attempts with traditional intranet software make data browsing a poor experience. We helped them to make their data publishing agile and data consumption a good experience. We customized, implemented and integrated the open source data portal CKAN with their systems."
