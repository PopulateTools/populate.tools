description: We compiled and proccessed more than 85 different datasets from different sources to provide a simple fact-sheet with key indicators about economy, demographics, employment, election results, budgets... for the +8.000 councils, provinces and spanish regions to give context for the coming elections. We also created interactive maps from the data, and tools to compare indicators from different councils or provinces. All data was indexed using Elastic Search and internal APIs were created to build new services from the data. More about the process.
