description: This legendary Spanish cultural institution (the residence of Dal√≠, Lorca and many others in their formative years) treasures tons of all kinds of material. They wanted to enable the public to browse the content and connections derived from thousands of letters from "La Edad de Plata", a golden age of Spanish culture in early 20th century. We helped them to visualize and explore the content in a modern and beatiful interface. In collaboration with <a href="http://visualizados.com">visualizados.com</a>.
