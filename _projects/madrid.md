description: We designed and developed the collaborative legislation module for the Consul participation software for Madrid City Council. This modules enables public bodies to comply with spanish law, which requires a public consultation online mechanism for any legislation change or adition. We created an interface to consult on general issues about legislation, and a collaborative text commenting interface to allow for debate and contributions over specific text parts.
