description: An interactive game to explore how tax evasion impacts African economies, in the context of the Panama Papers global investigation. ICIJ wanted to explore new ways of telling stories about tax evasion and Africa, a vast territory composed of many different countries which the western world doesn't know too much about. With this in mind we designed a game which mixes general issues about Africa and how they match with tax evasion. Project has been supported by the Pulitzer Center. <a href="https://www.icij.org/blog/2016/09/continent-of-secrets-untold-stories/">How we did it</a>.
