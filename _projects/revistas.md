description: This legendary Spanish cultural institution (the residence of Dal√≠, Lorca and many others in their formative years) treasures tons of all kinds of material. They had extracted entities (themes, people, movements, places, works...) in a corpus of magazines over 30 years, and they wanted an interface to understand connections and enable exploration. We helped them to envision the exploration experience, process data, and build the interactive application. In collaboration with <a href="http://visualizados.com">visualizados.com</a>.
