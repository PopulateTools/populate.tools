          <p><span>We are a</span> <button data-target="t1">small digital studio</button> <span>in Spain. We help you think about the</span> <span data-target="t2">things you should build</span>, <span>ask the</span> <span data-target="t3">questions to discover</span> <span>them and</span> <span class="t4">focus on the right work</span> <span>to do at a given stage.</span></p>

          <p>And then we help you to build the thing. So: <span data-target="product">product design</span> and <span data-target="implementation">implementation</span>. The big picture, the user experience, the technology, the launch, and the day to day chores.</p>

          <p>We have built quite a few projects along the years.</p>

          <p>We enjoy doing just the right amount of work, starting small, putting the work in hands of the users as soon as possible (because that's the way to learn), working in unexplored areas and strange projects, and working with like minded persons inside interesting organizations.</p>

          <p>We work with companies, NGOs and government organizations.</p>

          <p>We think that maybe we are using the first person plural too much and that you might enjoy having a chat to get to know each other.</p>

            <p>Populate was founded by √Ålvaro Ortiz & Fernando Blat in 2015. We have been working together for more than 20 years in different projects: offering business consultancy to big cos; creating online spaces for millions of users; defining and launching startups; organizing events and participating in communities.</p>

            <p>Asking the right questions is probably the most important super power to have in any aspect of life. Digital product building is no exception. Asking the appropriate questions alone defines most of what you need to build, what and how you need to offer to your public. </p>
            <p>Should we define our job as question-answering artisans? We might. With a little web development knowhow.</p>

            <p>Our roots are in user centered design. We take pride on coming up with polished user experiences, which usually means giving users only what they need and no more in the moment they need it.</p>
            <p>World is complex: digital products should get out of the way and provide calm and enlightning experiences.</p>
            <p>We use <strong>data visualization</strong> as a tool to give context and allow the quick understanding of complex issues.</p>
