    Asking the right questions is probably the most important super power to have in any aspect of life. Digital product building is no exception. Asking the appropriate questions alone defines most of what you need to build, what and how you need to offer to your public.
    
    Should we define our job as question-answering artisans? We might. With a little web development knowhow.
