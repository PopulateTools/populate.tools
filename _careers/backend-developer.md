## About Populate

We are a design and tech consultancy building digital products around civic engagement. We are hiring for [Gobierto Contracts](https://contratos.gobierto.es), which is our main focus right now: a tool to help public administrations control, plan and research about their contracting activity. Read [El por qué de Gobierto Contratación: hacer más eficiente la contratación pública](https://gobierto.es/blog/20210527-gobierto-contratacion.html) (spanish) about our motivation for building this tool — making public spending more efficient, nothing less!

During the last 12 months we'd have a pretty sweet customer discovery process, talking with tens of organizations to understand where their pains are. Now, a typical product presentation ends up with a "I want this now" (being "now" in the public administration land a process of many months... :D)

We have landed the first clients and have very exciting prospects for the coming months.

We value

- **open**: source, data, knowledge
- **balance**: design your work schedule around your life, not the other way round
- **communication**: remote-first approach. Good & orderly written communication > meetings > real time interruptions
- **quality**: pride in process and results
- **independence**: responsibility for your own work, not micromanaging


## How we work

Gobierto Contracts is a relatively young RoR project, so you'll be a key contributor to shape the basis of the code and will take ownership of the project. One of Gobierto Contracts' parts is a global search engine of tenders and contracts extracted from public sources. On top of this we are applying machine learning magic to do predictions, entity extraction from PDFs, and many other fun things.

You'll also be contributing from time to time to Gobierto Transparency, our open source solution for setting transparency and accountability initiatives.

We work on [Github](http://github.com/populatetools/) using a git workflow with CI/CD, tests, different automations... Our workflow has been polished throughout a few years, so have automated many things (monitoring, error tracking, server setups & updates, deployments, various checks...). You can take a look at the [Gobierto repo to see how we actually work](http://github.com/populatetools/gobierto).

Depending on your skills and interests, you may participate in:

- Data analysis work: using SQL, R, Python
- Systems work: servers setup, management, deploys. We use Ansible, some Docker

We are building an independent, self-financed, sustainable company with the objective of being in business for many years working on projects we believe in and that we think make the world a better place, bit by bit. Projects that are respectful with people and don't prioritize revenue over everything.

We are growing the business and aim to pay as best as we can.

## Hiring process

- You take some time to write the application (two questions to show your motivations on the role)

- We do a short chat over the phone. Do a longer one if everything is fine
- If we want you to join us, we'll make a salary proposal
- **Paid project**:
  - we want to test the relationship before committing full time so we (you and us) are sure it's a good fit. Changing jobs is stressful and time consuming and we don't want to lose anybody's time.
  - we'll propose a project of around 20-40 hours so you can combine it with your current job. We agree on the fee and you complete it when you can, without stress (2-3 weeks, but we are flexible and we can define an agreement based on personal circumstances)
  - alternately, you can do this project in the office
  - we pay you this project, no matter what
- If project is OK, everything is ready ;)
